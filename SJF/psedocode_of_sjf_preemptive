1- Traverse until all process gets completely
   executed.
   a) Find process with minimum remaining time at every single time lap.
   b) Reduce its time by 1.
   c) Check if its remaining time becomes 0
   d) Increment the counter of process completion.
   e) Completion time of current process = current_time +1;
   e) Calculate waiting time for each completed process.
      wt[i]= Completion time - arrival_time-burst_time
   f) Increment time lap by one.
2- Find turnaround time (waiting_time+burst_time).

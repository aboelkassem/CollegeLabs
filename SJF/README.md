# SJF
Implemented SJF algorithm (preemetive and non-preemptive) in `python` for scheduling works on the process with the shortest burst time or duration first.
> Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.
